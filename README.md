# design-patterns

Quick notes:

Creational 
  Singleton - only one instance of the object (settings configuration)
  Builder - solution to telescoping constructor (field setter)
  Prototype - cloning
  Factory - creates object via perimeter value (String)
  
Structural
  Composite - treating a group of object in similar way as single object (file system)
  Decorator - add functionality through class (File class, traits)
