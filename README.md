# design-patterns

Quick notes:
	
Singleton - only one instance of the object (settings configuration)
  
Builder - solution to telescoping constructor (field setter)
  
Prototype - cloning
  
Factory - creates object via perimeter value (String)
  

  
Composite - treating a group of object in similar way as single object (file system)
  
Decorator - add functionality through class (File class, traits)
